
The script gene_cluster_analysis.R performs hierachical clustering on the normalized gene expression profiles on all four celltypes: cardiomyocytes (CMs), endothelial cells (ECs), fibroblasts (FBs) and hematopoietic cells (HCs).
The genes are chosen that are significantly different in expression at any timepoint (maSigpro results)
k was set to 10 clusters to highlight the expression dynamics of the significant genes across all timepoints (Figures 2:A,E,I,M) of the manuscript.
