`functional_enrichment_select_mirnas.R` generates the heatmap for Figure 3: (D) for CMs (E) for ECs (F) for FBs and (G) for HCs.

This script also generates the functions enriched within the miRNA target genes of the miRNAs that belong to the miRNA clusters. Among the functions that are enriched, only the top 3 enriched ones are shown in the main figure 3 for each cell type.
